# Alternative: Detailed Onboarding Prompt

> **📋 Use this if new AI needs more guidance**

---

I'm Todd, working on the AGOG Print Industry ERP project. This is a new session picking up where the previous session left off.

**Step 1:** Read these files to understand the project (in this order):
1. `.github/AI_ONBOARDING.md` - Quick project overview and how we work together
2. `.github/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` - Exactly what we were working on and what's next
3. `CONSTRAINTS.md` - Critical rules that must NEVER be violated

**Step 2:** After reading all three files, please:
1. Summarize what we were working on
2. Tell me what the next task should be (from SESSION_CONTEXT.md)
3. Confirm you understand the key constraints (especially: UUIDv7, tenant_id filtering, Navigation Path requirements)
4. Ask any clarifying questions

Take your time reading - it's important to understand the context. The three files will tell you everything you need to know to continue seamlessly.

Ready when you are!
