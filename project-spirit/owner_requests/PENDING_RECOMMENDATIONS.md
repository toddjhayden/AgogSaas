- Multi-tenant foundation with RLS at database level
- Event infrastructure exists (NATS, WebSocket) but not fully utilized
- Strong domain model (lot genealogy, material traceability)

### Key Improvements Needed
- Event-driven architecture between modules
- Cross-module orchestration (order → production → warehouse → shipping)
- Caching layer for reference data
- Advanced algorithms (forecasting, optimization, maintenance)
- Global deployment support

### Strategic Opportunities
- 20-30% cycle time improvement through event-driven orchestration
- 25-30% forecast accuracy improvement through SARIMA
- 10-15% margin improvement through profitability analytics
- 40% supply chain efficiency improvement through supplier collaboration
- 50% equipment downtime reduction through predictive maintenance
