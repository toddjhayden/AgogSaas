## Pending Review

### REQ-STRATEGIC-AUTO-1767406497685: Implement OpenTelemetry Distributed Tracing for End-to-End Request Observability

**Status**: PENDING
**Owner**: marcus
**Priority**: P1
**Business Value**: OBSERVABILITY CRITICAL - System lacks distributed tracing capability. When user reports slow performance or errors, engineers cannot trace request flow across services. GraphQL resolvers call multiple services, agents trigger workflows, NATS events trigger cascading updates - no visibility into where time is spent. OpenTelemetry distributed tracing traces requests end-to-end, shows which service is slow, enables root cause analysis, reduces MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) from hours to minutes. Essential for production support and debugging complex distributed systems.
**Generated By**: strategic-recommendation-generator

**Business Value**: ARCHITECTURE SCALING - Monolithic backend prevents independent scaling (WMS needs 5 replicas, Finance needs 2). Entire backend redeploys as unit, limits deployment frequency. Single service failure brings down entire system. Extract payment processing, supplier portal, customer portal into independent microservices. Implement Istio service mesh for cross-service auth (mTLS), retry logic, circuit breakers, traffic shaping. Enables daily deployment frequency, parallel team development, targeted scaling, regional service isolation. Reduces blast radius: payment module failure doesn't impact WMS.

### REQ-STRATEGIC-AUTO-1767453456342: Tenant Isolation Security Verification & WebSocket Authentication

**Status**: PENDING
**Owner**: marcus
**Priority**: P0
**Business Value**: CRITICAL SECURITY - WebSocket authentication is stubbed with TODO comment (app.module.ts line 113-114). JWT validation placeholder code with hardcoded user/tenant IDs. Tenant context verification missing in WebSocket connections. Creates tenant isolation vulnerability: user connected to WebSocket for Tenant A could access Tenant B data if authentication logic is bypassed. Row-level security (RLS) triggers exist but WebSocket auth bypass makes RLS irrelevant. Implement actual JWT validation for WebSocket connections, verify tenant context in every query, comprehensive tenant isolation penetration test. Critical for compliance and data security.
