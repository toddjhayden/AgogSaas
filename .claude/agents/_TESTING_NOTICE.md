## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Testing Requirements

**BEFORE starting work, read:**
- ✅ `TESTING_ADDENDUM.md` (in this directory)
- ✅ `MANDATORY_TESTING_POLICY.md` (in project root)

**CRITICAL RULE:**

```
ALL WORK MUST BE TESTED BEFORE MARKING COMPLETE

CREATE → TEST (actually use it) → VERIFY → MARK COMPLETE
```

**You MUST provide evidence of testing to the orchestrator.**

**No testing = Work rejected = No exceptions**

See `TESTING_ADDENDUM.md` for your agent-type specific testing protocol.
