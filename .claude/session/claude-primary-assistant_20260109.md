# Claude Primary Assistant Session - January 9, 2026

## Session Summary
Continued REC/REQ unification architecture planning from January 8 session.

## Context from Previous Session
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow failures (deprecated actions v3→v4)
- Fixed Cloudflare Pages auto-deploy for SDLC GUI
- Marked CI/CD REQs as done (REQ-CICD-1767575020, REQ-SECURITY-1767575033, REQ-DEPLOY-1767575047)
- Discussed System Alerts architecture for Sam daemon audit timeout alerts

## Key Finding: Blocking System Ready for Unification

Analyzed `request_blockers` table (V0.0.28 migration) and confirmed:

### Schema Design
```sql
-- Blockers use UUID foreign keys to owner_requests
CONSTRAINT fk_blocked_request FOREIGN KEY (blocked_request_id)
  REFERENCES owner_requests(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
CONSTRAINT fk_blocking_request FOREIGN KEY (blocking_request_id)
  REFERENCES owner_requests(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
```

### Implications for Unification
1. **No blocker updates needed** - `request_blockers` only references `owner_requests.id` (UUIDs)
2. **Old `recommendations` table never integrated** - RECs couldn't participate in blocking
3. **Functions resolve req_number → UUID** - `add_request_blocker()` accepts strings but looks up UUIDs
4. **After migration, cross-type blocking works** - REQ-REQ, REC-REC, REQ-REC all supported

## Unification Readiness Checklist

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| V0.0.29 columns on VPS | ✅ Ready | `requires_approval`, `approval_status`, `source`, `tags` exist |
| `request_blockers` schema | ✅ Ready | Already references `owner_requests` only |
| Old RECs migration | ❌ Pending | Need to migrate from `recommendations` table |
| Tag filtering in API | ❌ Pending | Need endpoints to filter by tags |
| System Alerts GUI board | ❌ Pending | New board for Sam's alerts |

## Architecture Decision: Hybrid Tag-Based Routing

User approved hybrid approach:
- All items in unified `owner_requests` table
- Tags control which GUI board items appear on
- Sam continues creating REQs, but tagged for System Alerts board
- Less effort than separate tables, easier for agents

## REQ Created

**REQ-SDLC-1767972294**: Implement REC/REQ Unification with Tag-Based Board Routing
- Phase: `backlog`
- Priority: `high`
- Tags: `architecture`, `unification`, `sdlc-gui`, `internal-tooling`

### Requirements in REQ:
1. Migrate old RECs from recommendations table to owner_requests
2. Add tag filtering to SDLC API endpoints
3. Build System Alerts board in SDLC GUI
4. Update orchestrator to use unified queries

---

## SDLC System Status

```json
{
  "database": true,
  "nats": false,
  "entityCount": 32,
  "phaseCount": 14,
  "columnCount": 22
}
```

**Note**: NATS is currently disconnected. Embeddings for new REQ will be generated when NATS reconnects or via backfill script (`scripts/backfill-memory-embeddings.js`).

---

## Work Log

### Investigation: Blocking System Compatibility
- Read `V0.0.28__create_request_blockers.sql`
- Confirmed UUID-based foreign keys to `owner_requests`
- No migration of blocker records needed for unification

### REQ Creation
- Created REQ-SDLC-1767972294 via SDLC API
- REQ in backlog phase, ready for implementation
- NATS publish pending (NATS currently disconnected)

---

## AUDIT BLOCKER: Runtime Health Enforcement

**REQ-AUDIT-1767982074**: Enforce Runtime Dependency Health - Exit on Failure
- Priority: **CATASTROPHIC**
- Phase: `backlog`

### The Rule
**NO GRACEFUL ERROR HANDLING.** All workflow systems require all dependencies (NATS, SDLC, embeddings) working. If any go down, services MUST EXIT immediately.

### Current Violation
Services keep running when NATS down (`nats: false`) instead of exiting. This is audit-critical.

### Fix Required
All services must `process.exit(1)` when any critical dependency becomes unavailable. Process supervisor restarts service. Startup checks block until dependencies available.

### Affected Services
- strategic-orchestrator.service.ts
- sdlc-control.daemon.ts
- senior-auditor.daemon.ts (Sam)
- recommendation-publisher.service.ts
- value-chain.daemon.ts
- All agent spawners

---

## Rule Violation: Errors Downgraded to Warnings

**Commit `36576e3`** (January 8) violated the rule:
- Downgraded strict TypeScript rules from `error` to `warn`
- Disabled React Compiler rules

**The Rule**: Errors cause system breaks BY DESIGN. Never downgrade errors to warnings.

**Action Required**: Revert those ESLint changes. Fix the actual TypeScript errors instead.

---

## Bug: Catastrophic Priority Not Enforced

**Location**: `strategic-orchestrator.service.ts` lines 1043-1044

```typescript
const catastrophicReqs = mappedRequests.filter(r =>
  r.priority === 'catastrophic' && r.status !== 'BLOCKED'  // BUG: excludes blocked!
);
```

### Impact
- If all catastrophic items are BLOCKED, `hasCatastrophic = false`
- Catastrophic priority rule doesn't trigger
- Lower priority work proceeds while catastrophic sits blocked
- Blockers for catastrophic items don't get prioritized

---

## Sasha - Workflow Infrastructure Expert

### Created Files
1. **`.claude/WORKFLOW_RULES.md`** - Mandatory workflow rules (no graceful errors, no error→warning, etc.)
2. **`.claude/agents/sasha-workflow-expert.md`** - Sasha agent definition

### Sasha's Responsibilities
1. **Fix infrastructure issues** - NATS down, DB unreachable, embeddings down
2. **Answer rule questions** - Agents ask Sasha before doing risky things (e.g., "Can I downgrade this error?")
3. **Extend timeouts** - When agents need more time for legitimate work

### Agent Communication
- Agents request Sasha via NATS: `agog.agent.requests.sasha-rules`
- Sasha responds via: `agog.agent.responses.sasha-rules`
- Host listener spawns Sasha and relays responses

### Model Usage
- **Haiku** - Rule questions (fast, simple yes/no)
- **Sonnet** - Infrastructure recovery (complex debugging)

### Host Listener Integration (Pending)
The host-agent-listener.ts needs these additions:
1. Add `sasha` to agent files mapping
2. Add `checkWorkflowHealth()` method
3. Add `subscribeToSashaRuleQuestions()` subscription
4. Add `spawnSashaForRuleQuestion()` method (haiku)
5. Add `spawnSashaForInfraRecovery()` method (sonnet)
6. Call `subscribeToSashaRuleQuestions()` in start()

**Note**: File modification conflicts prevented automated edits. Manual integration required.

2. **SASHA - YOUR WORKFLOW TECHNICAL SUPPORT** - Instructions on how to contact Sasha:
   - NATS topic: `agog.agent.requests.sasha-rules`
   - Request format: `{ requestingAgent, question, context }`
   - Response topic: `agog.agent.responses.sasha-rules`

### NATS Topics for Sasha

| Topic | Direction | Purpose |

## CATASTROPHIC FIX DEPLOYED (Session 2 Continued)

**Commit:** `10d5128` - fix(orchestrator): CATASTROPHIC - Fix blocked P0 items excluded from priority check

### The Bug (Fixed)
```typescript
// BEFORE (BUG): Excluded blocked catastrophic items
const catastrophicReqs = mappedRequests.filter(r =>
  r.priority === 'catastrophic' && r.status !== 'BLOCKED'
);

// AFTER (FIXED): Include ALL catastrophic items
const catastrophicReqs = mappedRequests.filter(r =>
  r.priority === 'catastrophic'
);
const blockedCatastrophicReqs = catastrophicReqs.filter(r => r.status === 'BLOCKED');
```

### Impact
- Blocked P0 items now trigger catastrophic priority enforcement
- Blockers OF blocked P0 items now get prioritized
- Added logging for blocked catastrophic REQs

### Deployment Status

- Fixed duplicate filter menus - local filters hidden when global filters enabled
- Integrated Blocker Graph with cross-page filtering

### AI Chat Enhancements (Commit 96ed60a)

#### Expanded Model Lists
- **GitHub Models**: 30+ models including Llama 3.1/3.2/3.3, Mistral variants, Phi-4, Cohere, AI21, DeepSeek
- **Anthropic**: Added Claude Opus 4.5, updated model list
- **OpenAI**: Added o1, o3-mini, GPT-4 variants

---

## Current Tasks (Session 3 Continued)

### Priority 1: Fix AI Assist Dynamic Model Fetching
- Fetch available models from vendor API after user authenticates
- GitHub has ~9 models available to user
- Remove hardcoded model lists, query APIs instead

### Priority 2: Cross-Page Filtering Visibility
- All filtered pages should show what's currently filtered (especially Blocker Graph)
- Add visible filter indicator/menu to all pages using cross-page filtering

### Priority 3: Double-Click to Filter
- Double-click on REQ/REC numbers populates filter textbox
- Works on: Kanban cards, Recommendations cards, Blocker Graph items
- Blocker Graph special behavior: show blocked AND blocking items connected to filtered REQ/REC

### Priority 4: D3.js Graph Visualizations
- User wants to try D3.js for Blocker Graph and Entity Graph

### Future Work (After Current Tasks)
- Plan AI + SDLC database interaction (MCP or similar)
- Add security to AI experience
- Split agogsaas and SDLC projects

---

## Session 4: AI & Filtering Fixes (Continued)

### Dynamic AI Model Fetching (Commit fd69ebc)

Fixed the broken AI Assist by implementing dynamic model fetching:

#### Changes to `ai-providers.ts`:
- Renamed `availableModels` to `fallbackModels` (minimal fallback list)
- Added `modelsEndpoint` for each provider's models API
- Added `supportsModelFetching` flag
- Added `DynamicModelInfo` interface for fetched models
- Added `fetchedModels` and `modelsLastFetched` to `AIProviderConfig`

#### Changes to `useAIChatStore.ts`:
- Added `isLoadingModels: Record<string, boolean>` state
- Added `fetchModelsForProvider()` action with provider-specific logic:
  - **GitHub Models**: `GET /catalog/models` with Bearer token
  - **OpenAI**: `GET /v1/models` filtering for gpt/o1/o3 models
  - **Google Gemini**: `GET /v1beta/models?key=...` filtering for generateContent support
  - **DeepSeek**: `GET /models` (OpenAI-compatible)
- Auto-fetches models after `addProvider()`

#### Changes to `SettingsPage.tsx`:
- Model dropdown uses `fetchedModels` when available, else `fallbackModels`
- Added refresh button for providers that support model fetching
- Shows model count and last updated timestamp
- Shows loading spinner during fetch

### Cross-Page Filtering Improvements (Commit 140fa4b)

#### New `FilterStatus` Component:
- Always-visible filter indicator (even when filters disabled)
- Shows filter toggle ON/OFF state
- Displays active filters as color-coded badges:
  - Type (purple), Focused item (blue), Status (green), Priority (orange), Search (gray)
- Clear button for each filter and global reset

#### New `useDoubleClickFilter` Hook:
- Double-click any REQ/REC number to focus filter on it
- Automatically enables filters and sets focus
- Works on Kanban cards, Recommendation cards, Blocker Graph nodes

#### Updated Pages:
- **KanbanPage**: Added FilterStatus, double-click on REQ numbers
- **RecommendationsKanbanPage**: Added FilterStatus, double-click on REC numbers
- **BlockerGraphPage**: Added FilterStatus, double-click on REQ numbers

### Blocker Graph Connected Filtering (Commit d8fb95d)

Special filter behavior for Blocker Graph:
- When focusing on a REQ, shows the complete blocking chain context
- Displays: focused item + all items blocking it + all items it blocks
- Uses `getConnectedRequests()` function to find all connected items
- `filteredRequests` memo applies this logic when focus is active

### AI Chat Button Fix (Commit aa6afaa)
- Fixed floating ChatButton overlapping submit button in AI panel
- Now hidden when chat panel is open (close button in header is sufficient)

### D3.js Force-Directed Graphs (Commits 55446fb, c56409a)

#### D3BlockerGraph Component:
- Interactive force simulation for blocking relationships
- Nodes sized by number of items they block
- Color-coded by priority (critical=red, high=orange, medium=yellow, low=green)
- Stroke indicates blocked status
- Drag nodes to reposition, scroll to zoom, pan to move
- Click to select, double-click to filter
- Hover tooltip with request details
- Legend showing priority colors and interaction hints

#### D3EntityGraph Component:
- Force-directed layout for entity dependencies
- Nodes colored by business unit (core-infra=blue, sales=green, etc.)
- Size reflects total dependency count
- Hover highlights connected dependencies
- Click to select entity for details panel
- Business unit legend

#### Updated Pages:
- **BlockerGraphPage**: List/Graph view toggle
- **EntityGraphPage**: List/Graph view toggle

---

## Session 5: AI + SDLC Function Calling Implementation

### Planning Complete

Created comprehensive MCP/Function Calling integration plan at:
`.claude/plans/mcp-sdlc-integration.md`

### User's Desired AI Interactions

From sdlc.agog.fyi AI Assist, user wants to:
1. "Change REQ-X priority to catastrophic"
2. "Focus all workflow effort on REQ-X"
3. "What's blocked by REQ-X?"
4. "Prioritize unblocked work for 8 hours"
5. "Do easiest work this weekend"
6. "When will REQ-X be finished?"
7. "Optimize priorities for weekend productivity"
8. "What did Customer XLX request? Prioritize their needs."

### Architecture Decision

**Option B: Function Calling** (not MCP Server)
- Works with all AI providers in browser
- Dual approach: Native function calling + prompt-based fallback
- No project separation required

### Provider Support

| Provider | Function Calling |
|----------|------------------|
| OpenAI (GPT-4, o1) | ✅ Native |
| Anthropic (Claude) | ✅ Native (tools) |
| Google Gemini | ✅ Native |
| DeepSeek | ✅ Native |
| GitHub Models | ⚠️ GPT-4 yes, Llama no |

### Files Created

1. **`sdlc-gui/src/types/ai-functions.ts`** ✅
   - 11 Query functions (read-only)
   - 8 Mutation functions (require confirmation)
   - Provider-specific converters (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
   - Prompt-based fallback generator
   - Function call parser for non-native providers

### Functions Defined

**Query Functions:**
- `getRequestDetails` - Full request info
- `getBlockedByRequest` - Items blocked by a request
- `getBlockersForRequest` - What's blocking a request
- `getBlockerChain` - Recursive blocker tree
- `getUnblockedWork` - Available work sorted by priority/effort
- `getRequestsByCustomer` - Customer-specific requests
- `estimateCompletion` - ETA for request
- `analyzeWorkload` - What can be done in X hours
- `getRequestsByPriority` - Filter by priority
- `getRequestsByPhase` - Filter by phase
- `searchRequests` - Text search

**Mutation Functions:**
- `updateRequestPriority` - Change priority
- `setTopPriority` - Flag as most important
- `setWorkflowFocus` - Direct agent effort %
- `optimizePriorities` - Auto-optimize for timeframe
- `addBlocker` - Add blocker relationship
- `removeBlocker` - Remove blocker
- `createRecommendation` - Create new REC
- `updateRequestPhase` - Move to different phase

### Implementation Progress

- [x] Plan AI + SDLC integration
- [x] Create ai-functions.ts with definitions
- [x] Create ai-function-executor.ts
- [x] Add new SDLC API endpoints (10 new endpoints)
- [ ] Update useAIChatStore with function calling
- [ ] Add prompt-based fallback
- [ ] Test with multiple providers

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`sdlc-gui/src/types/ai-functions.ts`** - Function definitions + provider converters
2. **`sdlc-gui/src/services/ai-function-executor.ts`** - Function execution service
3. **`sdlc-gui/src/services/ai-function-handler.ts`** - Function calling orchestration
4. **`agent-backend/src/api/sdlc-api.server.ts`** - Added 10 new AI endpoints

### New API Endpoints Added

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/requests/:reqNumber/blocked-by` | GET | Items blocked BY a request |
| `/requests/:reqNumber/blocker-chain` | GET | Recursive blocker tree |
| `/requests/unblocked` | GET | Unblocked work (sortable) |
| `/requests/by-customer/:name` | GET | Customer-specific requests |
| `/requests/:reqNumber/estimate` | GET | Completion estimate |
| `/workload/analyze` | GET | What fits in X hours |
| `/requests/:reqNumber/priority` | POST | Update priority |
| `/requests/:reqNumber/top-priority` | POST | Set as #1 priority |
| `/requests/search` | GET | Text search |

### Remaining Integration Steps

To complete the AI + SDLC function calling:

1. **Modify `useAIChatStore.ts`** - In `sendMessage()`:
   - Import `buildFunctionSystemPrompt`, `extractFunctionCalls`, `executeFunctionCallsWithConfirmation` from `ai-function-handler.ts`
   - Wrap base system prompt with `buildFunctionSystemPrompt(basePrompt)`
   - After getting AI response, call `extractFunctionCalls(responseText)`
   - If function calls found, execute them and build follow-up message
   - Display function results in chat

2. **Add confirmation dialog** in `AIChatPanel.tsx`:
   - Show modal when mutation function needs confirmation
   - Pass confirmation callback to store

3. **Test with providers**:
   - GitHub Models (GPT-4o) - native function calling
   - Claude - native tool use
   - DeepSeek - native function calling
   - Llama (GitHub) - prompt-based fallback

### User's Desired Use Cases (May Require Agentic Workflow Changes)

From sdlc.agog.fyi AI Assist, user wants to be able to say:

| User Command | Function | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| "Change critical to catastrophic" | `updateRequestPriority` | ✅ Implemented |
| "Flag REQ-X as most important thing to work on" | `setTopPriority` | ✅ Implemented |
| "Focus all percent effort into REQ-X" | `setWorkflowFocus` | ⚠️ May need orchestrator changes |
| "What is blocked by REQ-X?" | `getBlockedByRequest` | ✅ Implemented |
| "Prioritize all unblocked work for next 8 hours" | `getUnblockedWork` + `optimizePriorities` | ⚠️ May need orchestrator changes |
| "Do the easiest work over the weekend" | `getUnblockedWork(sortBy: effort_asc)` | ✅ Implemented |
| "When can I expect REQ-X to be finished?" | `estimateCompletion` | ✅ Implemented |
| "Rearrange priorities to get most work done this weekend" | `optimizePriorities` | ⚠️ Needs backend logic |
| "What was created from Customer XLX? Prioritize their needs" | `getRequestsByCustomer` + `optimizePriorities` | ⚠️ Needs backend logic |

**Agentic Workflow Changes Needed:**
- `setWorkflowFocus` - Orchestrator needs to read workflow_directives table and adjust agent allocation
- `optimizePriorities` - Backend needs algorithm to reorder priorities based on goal

### Example Prompts (For User Reference)

```
# Query Examples
"What's blocking REQ-P0-BUILD-1767507808-DB?"
"Show me all unblocked work sorted by easiest first"
"What can I complete in 8 hours?"
"Find requests from customer Acme Corp"
"When will REQ-SDLC-1767972294 be done?"

# Mutation Examples (Will Ask Confirmation)
"Change REQ-X priority to catastrophic"
"Set REQ-X as the top priority"
"Add blocker: REQ-A is blocked by REQ-B"
"Create recommendation: Upgrade database before migration"
```
