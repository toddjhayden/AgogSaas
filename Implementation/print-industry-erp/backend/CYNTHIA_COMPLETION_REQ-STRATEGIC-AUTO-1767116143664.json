  "summary": "Completed comprehensive research for Real-Time Business Intelligence & Self-Service Analytics. Analyzed existing analytics infrastructure (5 database views, GraphQL API, export services), identified critical gaps (no real-time streaming, no self-service query builder, analytics service using mock data), and provided detailed technology recommendations with 4-phase implementation roadmap (66-85 person-days). Research document includes database schema designs, integration patterns, security considerations, and cost-benefit analysis showing 2-3x ROI.",

      "Identified that existing analytics views (vendor_production_impact_v, customer_profitability_v, order_cycle_analysis_v, material_flow_analysis_v, executive_kpi_summary_mv) are disconnected from analytics service",
      "Discovered analytics.service.ts returns hardcoded mock data instead of querying database views - requires database integration",
      "Found no real-time capabilities - missing GraphQL Subscriptions, WebSocket infrastructure, and required npm packages (@nestjs/websockets, ws, graphql-ws)",
      "Identified absence of self-service analytics features - no query builder, no saved reports, no custom dashboards",
      "Documented export service gaps - using /tmp/exports instead of cloud storage, email delivery not implemented",
      "Recommended 4-phase implementation: Phase 1 (Database Integration 15-20 days), Phase 2 (Real-Time Streaming 18-25 days), Phase 3 (Self-Service Analytics 20-25 days), Phase 4 (Advanced Features 13-15 days)",
      "Designed new database tables: saved_reports, custom_dashboards, dashboard_widgets, report_schedules, custom_metrics",
      "Specified technology stack: GraphQL Subscriptions over SSE, react-querybuilder for query builder, react-grid-layout for dashboards, Chart.js for visualizations",
      "Provided security recommendations: RLS policies for saved reports/dashboards, audit logging for all analytics access, rate limiting for real-time subscriptions",
      "Calculated cost-benefit analysis: Implementation cost $25,000-$33,750, estimated annual value $50,000-$100,000, ROI 2-3x in first year"
