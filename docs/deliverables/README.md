## File Naming Convention

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | Feature implementation documentation |
| `AUDIT-REPORT-REQ-*.md` | Security/code audit reports |
| `QA-REPORT-*.md` | QA testing results |
| `DELIVERABLE-REQ-*.md` | Completed request deliverables |
| `DEVOPS_VERIFICATION_*.md` | DevOps verification reports |
| `DEVOPS_CRITIQUE_*.md` | DevOps review feedback |

## Workflow

1. Implementation docs are created during feature development
2. QA reports are generated after testing
3. Audit reports are produced by security reviews
4. DevOps verification confirms deployment readiness
